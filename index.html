                <br>
                <br>
                Through this program, students will improve their professionalism, discipline, 
                and leadership to ultimately graduate as RED Leaders. We will ensure each student 
                receives the right coaching and information as they navigate through their early careers in finance.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once students graduate as RED Leaders, they will continue their professional journey
                by engaging in monthly meetings with a volunteer mentor.
